      <p className={classes.paragraph}>
        Welcome to our Animal Shelter. We are a non-profit organization based in
        Kazakhstan, dedicated to rescuing stray, abandoned, and mistreated
        animals. Our mission is to provide them with food, shelter, medical
        care, and ultimately find them loving forever homes.

      <p className={classes.paragraph}>
        Since our founding, we&#39;ve helped hundreds of dogs and cats get a
        second chance at life. We believe that every animal deserves compassion,
        care, and a safe place to call home.
